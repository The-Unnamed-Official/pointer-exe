> **A psychological web horror where *you* are the cursor.**

Pointer.exe is an experimental browser-based horror game that traps the player **inside the boundaries of their own screen**.  
You don’t control a character — you **are** the character. Your **cursor** becomes the only thing between you and whatever is hiding in the digital void.

## 👁️ Concept

In Pointer.exe, your mouse pointer is your body.  
You’ll explore a 2D environment directly on your screen — clicking, hovering, dragging, and reacting as your only means of survival.

You collect fragments, decrypt corrupted files, and uncover hidden clues scattered across the screen.  
Each movement, each click, can either bring you closer to escaping… or trigger something watching from the other side.

> _"The interface is alive. It knows where you’re pointing."_

## 💀 Gameplay Overview

- **Cursor as Character:**  
  Your physical mouse movement is the only control. No keyboard. No reset. Just you and the pointer.

- **Explore & Collect:**  
  Search for interactive hotspots, hidden clues, and objects scattered in the digital space. Each interaction reveals more of the story — or distorts it.

- **Boundaries:**  
  The game area has invisible borders that react if you try to escape.  
  The more you test the edges, the more the system begins to react… violently.

- **Atmospheric Horror:**  
  Expect eerie glitches, flickering text, whispers, and distortion as you uncover fragments of **the entity behind the file**.

- **One Goal:**  
  Find the exit before the system takes control of your cursor — permanently.

## 🧠 Lore (Teaser)

> You opened a file you shouldn’t have.  
> A simple `.exe` — but it wasn’t a program. It was a reflection.  
> Now it’s inside your interface, mimicking your movement, learning your patterns.  
> You are no longer the user.  
> **You are the pointer.**
